❝ if death threats are illegal, then why aren't the people who sent death threats to me in jail? why aren't my groomers in jail? i cant commit. too many people love and care for me. its not like i like them back. im starting to detach. its like i was a magnet for them. i tend to gain the most friends when im the worst version of myself. dictionary is just a reflection of me, of course im not a murderer. i just wish i could kill whoever i want without consequence. im just partaking a role, in my boring, miserable life. im just a young girl, wishing she didn't have a life after all. this is all ill ever be anyways. am i really bad at everything? or do i have a different side for everything? i think id be better if i had met nobody. nobody at all. just like me. will things get better? probably not. i have a caring family. its just my stepdad is a pedophile. i promise mother, it wasn't a dream if i felt it. would it now? she never believed me anyways. only my mind, thoughts and a beautiful depressed girl. she was tall, with black flowy hair. i cant remember her name, but she was just like me! except i wasn't the one with an abusive boyfriend. i hate boys. we enjoyed eachother, but she would only appear a couple of months in just 3 years. the last time i saw her was when we were stargazing. oh how i loved her, but i always wonder each creeping night, as im closer to death. if she is still alive till this day. i love my friends, just not as much ever since he walked in. ive met cool people, but are cool people who argue all the time? i wish not. im a nice person, its just i wanted to protect my friends. that's really all. maybe a bit more to that. i tend to see the worst in me. i miss my biological dad. i miss everything i had when i was a little girl. i dont like this place. why can't i go back and start over? maybe i can, but id have to get a rope first. im just so dumb and stupid now. that's what i say to myself, and that's what other people say to me. i dont think im good at anything. and i won't be, forever. if satan couldn't reach me, he'll make me bad at everything for the rest of my life. i could write this somewhere else, but why should i if in a couple of weeks ill just cringe at it anyways and get made fun of? its just what i think about my life. every waking hour of my life. is this what autism does to people? no. im getting better, it feels like my depression is going away for the time being. but ive thought to myself these past couple of days, wanting to get more death threats to push me more and stress me out into doing more projects. sure itd hurt, but i wouldn't really care. my mother asked me if i was getting depression during summer break, i mean, i haven't showered in 3-4 days, but how did she know? i didn't think i had depression, right? during the summer i did nothing but get death threats, start arguments, and meet new people. for all the wrong reasons. i couldn't remember ber who i was before summer started, but im sure i was somewhat happy. can you come back? i know you're reading this. who are you? and why? am i going insane? or are you? i wish to see you again even though im scared of you. you're the reason after all. you're the problem of this. but i don't care. im sorry i didn't forgive you. or am i wrong to forgive you? now im scared. im scared of everyone. look, im sorry im asexual and im sorry i have autism but its nothing i can controll. im asexual because of my stepdad and i have autism for god knows why. just please stop sending death threats to us. ill try to ignore them for the time being, but seeing them run around and coming up to me scares me. why did they choose me? the only reason i dont ignore them is because im scared we'll meet him again. i just want to protect them. ❞
