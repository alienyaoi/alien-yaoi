i like writing.

❝ if death threats are illegal, then why aren't the people who sent death threats to me in jail? why aren't my groomers in jail? i cant commit. too many people love and care for me. its not like i like them back. im starting to detach. its like i was a magnet for them. i tend to gain the most friends when im the worst version of myself. dictionary is just a reflection of me, of course im not a murderer. i just wish i could kill whoever i want without consequence. im just partaking a role, in my boring, miserable life. im just a young girl, wishing she didn't have a life after all. this is all ill ever be anyways. am i really bad at everything? or do i have a different side for everything? i think id be better if i had met nobody. nobody at all. just like me. will things get better? probably not. i have a caring family. its just my stepdad is a pedophile. i promise mother, it wasn't a dream if i felt it. would it now? she never believed me anyways. only my mind, thoughts and a beautiful depressed girl. she was tall, with black flowy hair. i cant remember her name, but she was just like me! except i wasn't the one with an abusive boyfriend. i hate boys. we enjoyed eachother, but she would only appear a couple of months in just 3 years. the last time i saw her was when we were stargazing. oh how i loved her, but i always wonder each creeping night, as im closer to death. if she is still alive till this day. i love my friends, just not as much ever since he walked in. ive met cool people, but are cool people who argue all the time? i wish not. im a nice person, its just i wanted to protect my friends. that's really all. maybe a bit more to that. i tend to see the worst in me. i miss my biological dad. i miss everything i had when i was a little girl. i dont like this place. why can't i go back and start over? maybe i can, but id have to get a rope first. im just so dumb and stupid now. that's what i say to myself, and that's what other people say to me. i dont think im good at anything. and i won't be, forever. if satan couldn't reach me, he'll make me bad at everything for the rest of my life. i could write this somewhere else, but why should i if in a couple of weeks ill just cringe at it anyways and get made fun of? its just what i think about my life. every waking hour of my life. is this what autism does to people? no. ❞
